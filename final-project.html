				<h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
				<p>Feature prioritization is best in finding a minimal viable product which satisfies most users. The features I listed are Styling, photos, navigation, uniqueness, contact and resume. I find that although styling and innovative deisng helps a lot, it is the most difficult feature.</p>

				<p>User stories addresses each feature to a simple goal-driven senorio in order to pin-point potential problem and improvement. I was not able to think of many user stories at frist, but different types of users eventually came up. Perfect (for me) to locate potential stakeholders.</p>

				<h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
				<p>Cognitive walkthrough allows developers to see how users' mental models are formed towards the design. This activity allows me to see how users actually react to my website. I learned a lot from watching them clicking and finding informaiton for only two minutes. For example, I find that no one really finishes raeding my bio paragraph, so I dicided to chop it into miltliple paragraphes.</p>

				<h4>User Test</h4>
				<p>I made a click test and a question test. The click test result is stunningly well, mostly due to the question might be too easy. The question test reponses is interesting because some of the participants actually think that my website is for introducing video games, although it is only mentiond in bio. </p>

	<h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
	<section class="userResearch"><p>The User interviews should be the most helpful one, but because partipants I chose are all classmates, they have similar need as mine, coult not provide a lot  more insights. For me, the Competitor analysis really helped to find what do people look for on these portfolio websites. I find that a full resume is really important to have. From later user stories and cognitive walkthrough where I can see or imagnie more about my users, I come to the conclusion that my site is lack of details and content. However, adding more contents in contradicts the problem of having too much information for the users to take all at once (the bio paragraph). So it can become a challenge to correctly format the content in a way that is not overwhelming. </p>

	<p>Creating user story was painful but helpful. I did not thought of many types of users when first building the portfolio. The stakeholders I had in mind were professors and hiring managers. In the user stories, I was forced to think about who else is going to visit this site and what do they want to do with it. For example, I find a personal blog with pictures should be ideal for telling life stories in a way that is not boring for users, it is inspired by thinking of my friends or classmates as potential users. </p>

	<p>The User Testing I think would be most helpful only yielded little valuable results, problems like not labeling paragraphs are already found in the early process. But it was reassuring to know typical user understands the layout of my website.</p>
	<p></p></section>

	<h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
	<section class="userResearch"><p>As I said in the findings, I have to chop my bio into different sections to allow the users scan more efficiently and gain overall idea quickly. Wanted to add anonymous message board because from the user stories I know that people have needs to complain freely and anonymously. </p><p>Also, I should also attach a full resume on the website, at least make it downloadable instead only having merely a experience section. In order to make the "experience" more attractive, I am planning to create a personal blog instead, mostly for friends and people who know me see what is going on with me and catch up with me easier. </p></section>
